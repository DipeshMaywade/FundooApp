### Short description about installed npm packages.

**bcrypt**

> **[Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)** is a password-hashing function. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.

**bluebird**

> **[Bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird)** is a fully featured promise library with focus on innovative features and performance.

**dotenv**

> **[Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)** is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

**express**

> **[Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)** The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

**express-graphql**

> **[Express-Graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql)** GraphQL has become an immensely popular alternative to REST APIs. The flexibility you get from using GraphQL makes it easier for developers to get any information they need for an app, and just the information they need for that portion of the app.

**graphql**

> **[Graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql)** The JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL, a query language for APIs created by Facebook. GraphQL lets you ask for what you want in a single query, saving bandwidth and reducing waterfall requests. It also enables clients to request their own unique data specifications.

**joi**

> **[Joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi)** The most powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript.

**jsonwebtoken**

> **[Jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)** Information Exchange: JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties because they can be signed, which means you can be sure that the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, the structure of a JWT allows you to verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

**mongodb**

> **[Mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb)** The official MongoDB Node.js driver allows Node.js applications to connect to MongoDB and work with data. The driver features an asynchronous API which allows you to interact with MongoDB using Promises or via traditional callbacks.

**mongoose**

> **[Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)** is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.

**nodemailer**

> **[Nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)** is a Node. js module that allows you to send emails from your server with ease. Whether you want to communicate with your users or just notify yourself when something has gone wrong, one of the options for doing so is through mail.

**redis**

> **[Redis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis)** is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams.

**amqplib**

> **[amqplib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqplib)** is an application layer protocol that lets client applications talk to the server and interact. However, AMQP should not just be considered a protocol used for over-the-wire communication; AMQP defines both the network layer protocol and a high-level architecture for message brokers.
